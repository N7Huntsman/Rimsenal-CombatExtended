# Rimsenal-CombatExtended
By N7Huntsman and WereCat88

A combined patch for all the Rimsenal mods, including core and sub-modules.

Note: The only item actually required by this patch among those listed is Combat Extended. Players may pick and choose Rimsenal modules as they see fit--this mega patch will work with any combination. There are a handful of textures, .xml items, and sound files copied directly from Rimsenal or only slightly modified that prevent Rimworld from logging (mostly harmless) errors when particular modules aren't loaded.

Created by N7Huntsman and LazerWereCat.

A special thanks to Rooki12 for the excellent Rimsenal series, and to the Combat Extended team and the folks on the Rimworld discord for their advice.
